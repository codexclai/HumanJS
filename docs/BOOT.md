# HumanJS — session boot

**Updated:** 2026-11-10  
**Canonical source:** public GitHub repository `codexclai/HumanJS`, branch `main`.

Read this file first whenever a new session begins. GitHub `main` is authoritative. The ChatGPT Project Sources area is expected to be empty; no upload or local snapshot is a project dependency.

## Mandatory reading order

1. This file.
2. `docs/PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
3. `docs/OWNER-REQUIREMENTS.md`.
4. `docs/architecture/SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md`.
5. `docs/spec/BRAIN-SCOPE-AND-COMPLETENESS.md`.
6. `docs/REPOSITORY-STRUCTURE.md`.
7. `docs/decisions/DECISIONS.md`.
8. `docs/roadmap/MASTER-ROADMAP.md`.
9. `docs/status/STATUS.md`.
10. `docs/operations/GITHUB-SECURITY.md`.
11. `docs/policies/REPOSITORY-HYGIENE.md`.
12. Read only the research, experiment, API, implementation, and issue records relevant to the current task.

Do not search for or request old uploads or copied source snapshots. If evidence or a design detail is missing, research or generate the needed current record from reliable sources when the task requires it.

## Current authoritative decisions

- Repository `codexclai/HumanJS`, branch `main`, is the sole source of truth for current code, documentation, requirements, decisions, research, experiments, issues, workflows, and history.
- ChatGPT Project Sources may remain empty. No project ZIP or separate source synchronization artifact is maintained or delivered.
- Keep the working tree focused on current project files. Do not add legacy source archives, duplicate inputs, general backup trees, or unreviewed historical project dumps.
- Repository is public and licensed Apache-2.0.
- Approved stack: Rust (native core), WGSL (GPU compute), Python (developer interface), C (ABI), and C++ (interop).
- Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, npm, JavaScript runtimes, and `.ajs` implementation are discontinued.
- Scope is a scientifically defensible computational model of the human brain only, not a whole-body simulator or chatbot.
- Preserve correct save/restore, Rust-native multi-threaded execution, and a configurable 10,000-spiking-neuron-unit default. This is an engineering default, not a biological count or hard maximum.
- CPU execution must work. GPU support is not a capability claim until actual hardware integration, correctness checks, and reproducible benchmarks succeed.
- Keep model definitions, initial conditions, live state, learned state, and checkpoints distinct.
- HumanJS has no requirement to store credentials, private user data, or secrets. Do not introduce authentication or generic secret/configuration infrastructure without an approved requirement.

## Branch policy

`main` is the only branch to use, permanently. Never create, check out, update, merge, or otherwise use another branch. Make authorized changes directly on `main`. Do not create branches, PRs, or automation that opens non-main update branches. No branch protection, rulesets, or deletion-prevention settings are required. Force pushes are permitted but exceptional and must be inspected and verified.

The latest live inspection on 2026-11-10 found nine non-main refs in addition to `main`. All nine diverge from `main` and each has one unique commit, with `main` ahead by 8–16 commits. They are unused leftovers. The connected GitHub tools can list and compare refs but do not expose branch deletion; no authenticated browser session was available for that operation. Do not use or update those refs, and never claim they were deleted. Recheck the live branch list and deletion capability in a future session.

## Session procedure

1. Retrieve repository metadata and verify the owner/repository, public/private state, and default branch.
2. Fetch the live `main` HEAD and inspect the entire tracked tree. When using a local checkout, clone/fetch from GitHub and verify the checked-out commit equals the live `main` HEAD.
3. Inspect recent commits, open issues/PRs, the latest main workflow runs, and relevant CI checks. Do not use non-main refs.
4. Read this file and follow the mandatory reading order.
5. Inspect relevant source, interfaces, dependencies, data flow, and tests before editing.
6. Commit authorized changes directly to `main`; verify the commit and resulting remote HEAD.
7. Run relevant checks and report exact commands/results, failures, timeouts, and unrun checks.
8. Update canonical documentation, current status, and handoff after meaningful work.
9. Verify all GitHub operations and disclose capability limits.

## Current implementation starting point

The repository is a documentation and governance foundation; no executable simulation implementation is established. The preparation baseline is ready for implementation. Start with a minimal Rust workspace and one integrated CPU-only simulation vertical slice. Choose modules from real ownership and data flow, define typed time/state/error/resource contracts, implement a causally testable mechanism, and add numerical and behavioral tests. Add save/restore and Rust-native concurrency as explicit tested capabilities, not placeholders. Research only the evidence needed for each mechanism and record provenance, species, methods, uncertainty, and validation limits.
